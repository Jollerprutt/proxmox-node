# Your Proxmox Node Build
The following build is for two hard metal proxmox nodes and one Synology VM proxmox container - total of three so we have a quorum.

Hardware includes 1x Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 with 6x Gigabit NICs, 1x Intel i3 NUC model nuc5i3ryh and 1x Synology DS1515+ with 4x NICs. Both the Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 and Intel NUC model nuc5i3ryh are low wattage at 15W TDP, CPU's are  2x core / 4x thread Intel CPUs, support Intel AES-ni instruction sets (for OpenVPN), support HD 4K GPU, Intel NIC's, and have at least 2x SATA 6.0 Gb/s Ports each to install two SSD's.

Each node is installed with 16Gb of RAM. 

All the network gear is Ubiquiti Networks which is a dream to configure. 

Obviously you can modify these instructions for your own hardware.

Network prerequisites are:
- [x] Network Gateway is `192.168.1.5`
- [x] Network DNS server is `192.168.1.5` (Note: on your DNS server 192.168.1.5, like a UniFi USG Gateway, set the following: primary DNS `192.168.1.254` which is your PiHole server IP address; secondary DNS `1.1.1.1` which is a Cloudfare DNS server)
- [x] Network DHCP server is `192.168.1.5`

Other Prerequisites are:
- [x] Synology NAS, Synology Virtual Machine Manager, including NFS, is fully configured as per [synobuild](https://github.com/ahuacate/synobuild)

Tasks to be performed are:
- [ ] Proxmox OS Installation
- [ ] Update Proxmox OS and enable turnkeylinux templates

## 1. Proxmox OS Installation
Each proxmox node requires two hard disks. Basically one is for the Proxmox OS and the other disk is setup as Proxmox ZFS shared storage disk.

SCSi and SATA controller devices designate disk names as sda,sdb,sdc and so on - generic linux naming convention. So disk one is often device sda but in some hardware its not so best check because in these instructions disk two is your Proxmox ZFS shared storage disk so the disk size should be common across all nodes. For ease and to avoid confusion SATA disk devices are referred to as sdx.

The Proxmox OS disk one requires a minimum of 60 Gb but a 120 Gb SSD disk is about the smallest these days. You could also use a USB dom for the Proxmox OS but a generic consumer USB thumbdrive or SDcard is not recommended because Proxmox has a fair amount of Read/Write activity.

Disk two (sdx) I recommend a 500 Gb SSD which will be used as a Proxmox ZFS shared storage disk for the cluster. But my installation uses a 250 Gb SSD.

Create your Proxmox installation USB media (instructions [here](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_from_USB_Stick)), set your nodes bios boot loader order to Hard Disk first / USB second (so you can boot from your proxmox installation USB media), and install proxmox.

For your Synology Virtual Machine Proxmox VM pre-setup follow the the instructions [HERE](https://github.com/ahuacate/synobuild#install--configure-synology-virtual-machine-manager). Remember to remove your USB media on reboot on the hard metal hardware. Configure each node as follows:

| Option | Node 1 Value | Node 2 Value | Node 3 Value |
| :---  | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Filesystem` |ext4 |ext4|ext4
| `Disk(s)` |sdx|sdx|sdx
| `Country` |"select"|"select"|"select"
| `Timezone` |"select"|"select"|"select"
| `Keymap` |en-us|en-us|en-us
| `E-mail` |"your email"|"your email"|"your email"
| `Management interface` |default|default|default
| `Hostname` |typhoon-01|typhoon-02|typhoon-03
|`IP` |192.168.1.101|192.168.1.102|192.168.1.103
| `Netmask` |255.255.255.0| 255.255.255.0| 255.255.255.0
| `Gateway` |192.168.1.5|192.168.1.5|192.168.1.5
| `DNS` |192.168.1.5|192.168.1.5|192.168.1.5
Please use your supplied password.

### 1.1 Configure the Proxmox Hardware
Further configuration is done via the Proxmox web interface. Just point your browser to the IP address given during installation (https://yournodesipaddress:8006). Default login is "root" (realm PAM) and the root password you defined during the installation process.

### 1.2 Update Proxmox OS and enable turnkeylinux templates
Using the web interface `updates` > `refresh` search for all the latest required updates.
Next install the updates using the web interface `updates` > `_upgrade` - a pop up terminal will show the installation steps of all your required updates.

Next install turnkeylinux container templates by using the web interface CLI `shell` and type
`pveam update`

### 1.3. Create Disk Two
Create Disk Two using the web interface `Disks` > `ZFS` > `Create: ZFS` and configure each node as follows:

| Option | Node 1 Value | Node 2 Value | Node 3 Value |
| :---  | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Name` |typhoon-share|typhoon-share|typhoon-share
| `RAID Level` |Single Disk|Single Disk|Single Disk
| `Compression` |on|on|on
| `ashift` |12|12|12
| `Device` |/dev/sdx|/dev/sdx|/dev/sdx

Note: If your choose to use a ZFS Raid for storage redundancy change accordingly per node but your must retain the Name ID **typhoon-share**.

## 2. Configure Proxmox OS
In this build the three Proxmox nodes are running to form a cluster and quorum. But the first node, typhoon-01, will also host a pfSense VM managing two OpenVPN Gateway services for the whole network (no redundancy for OpenVPN services as its deemed non critical).

Configuration options are determined by hardware types:
   * Node 1 - typhoon-01 - Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 is a 6x Gigabit NIC Router (6 LAN ports).
   * Node 2 - typhoon-02 - A single NIC x86 machine (1 LAN port).
   * Node 3 - typhoon-03 - Synology VM (1 Virtio LAN port)

### 2.1  NFS mounts to NAS
All three Proxmox nodes use NFS to mount data stored on a NAS so these instructions are applicable for all proxmox nodes. Your NFS server should be prepared and ready - Synology NFS Server instructions are available [HERE](https://github.com/ahuacate/synobuild#create-the-required-synology-shared-folders-and-nfs-shares).

The NFS mounts to be configured are: | `backup` | `docker`| `music` | `photo` | `public` | `video` | 
Configuration is by the Proxmox web interface. Just point your browser to the IP address given during installation (https://yournodesipaddress:8006). Default login is "root" (realm PAM) and the root password you defined during the installation process.

Using the web interface `Datacenter` > `Storage` > `Add` > `NFS` configure as follows:

| Cyclone-01-backup | Value |
| :---  | :---: |
| `ID` |cyclone-01-backup|
| `Server` |192.168.1.10|
| `Export` |/volume1/proxmox/backup|

## 3. Qotom Multi NIC Network Setup - Typhoon-01
Qotom hardware is unlike a Intel Nuc or any other single network NIC host (including Synology Virtual Machines) because a Qotom has two or more network NICs. In the following setup we use a Qotom Mini PC model Q500G6-S0 which is a 6x port Gigabit NIC PC router.

If you are using a Qotom 4x Gigabit NIC model then you CANNOT create LAGS/Bonds because you do not have enough ports. So configure Proxmox bridges only.

In order to create VLANs within a Virtual Machine (VM) for containers like Docker or a LXC, you need to have a Linux Bridge. Because we use a Qotom with 6x Gigabit NICs we can use NIC bonding (also called NIC teaming or Link Aggregation, LAG) which is a technique for binding multiple NICâ€™s to a single network device. By doing link aggregation, two NICs can appear as one logical interface, resulting in double speed. This is a native Linux kernel feature that is supported by most smart L2/L3 switches with IEEE 802.3ad.

We are going to use 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation (802.3ad)(LACP) so your switch must be 802.3ad compliant. This creates aggregation groups of NICs which share the same speed and duplex settings as each other. A link aggregation group (LAG) combines a number of physical ports together to make a single high-bandwidth data path, so as to implement the traffic load sharing among the member ports in the group and to enhance the connection reliability.

### 3.1. Configure your Network Switch
This example is based on UniFi US-24 port switch. Just transpose the settings to UniFi US-48 or whatever brand of Layer 2 switch you use. As a matter of practice I make the last switch ports 21-24 (on a UniFi US-24 port switch) a LAG Bond or Link Aggregation specically for the Synology NAS connection (referred to as 'balanced-TCP | Dynamic Link Aggregation IEEE 802.3ad' in the Synology network control panel) and the preceding 6x ports are reserved for the Qotom / typhoon-01 hosting the pfSense OpenVPN Gateways.

Configure your network switch LAG groups as per following table.

| 24 Port Switch | Port ID | Port ID |Port ID | Port ID |Port ID | Port ID | Port ID |Port ID | Port ID |Port ID | Port ID | Port ID |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|**Port Number** | `1` | `3` |`5` | `7` |`9` | `11` | `13` | `15` |`17` | `19` |`21` | `23` |
|**Port Number** | `2` | `4` |`6` | `8` |`10` | `12` | `14` | `16` |`18` | `20` |`22` | `24` |
|**LAG Bond** |  |  | |  | |  |  | LAG 15-16 | LAG 17-18 |  | LAG 21-24 | LAG 21-24 |
|**Switch Port Profile / VLAN** |  |  | |  | |  |  | All | VPN-egress (2) | LAN-vpngate-world (30) / LAN-vpngate-local (40) | All | All |
|**LAN CAT6A cable connected to** |  |  | |  | |  | Port14 -> typhoon-02 | Port15+16 -> typhoon-01 (NIC1+2) | Port17+18 -> typhoon-01 (NIC3+4) | Port19 -> typhoon-01 (NIC5) : Port20 -> typhoon-01 (NIC6)  |  |  |
||||||||||||
|**Qotom NIC Ports** |  |  | |  | |  |  | Port 1+2 | Port 3+4 | Port 5+6 |  |  |
|**Proxmox Linux Bond** |  |  | |  | |  |  | `bond0` | `bond1` |  |  |  |
|**Proxmox Bridge** |  |  | |  | |  |  | `vmbr0` | `vmbr1` | `vmbr2/vmbr3` |  |  |
|**Proxmox Comment** |  |  | |  | |  |  | Proxmox LAN Bond | VPN-egress Bond | vpngate-world/vpngate-local|  |  |

Note the **Switch Port Profile / VLAN** must be preconfigured in your network switch. The above table, based on a UniFi US-24 model, shows port 15+16 are link agregated (LAG), port 17+18 are another LAG and ports 19 and 20 are not LAG'd. So ports 15 to 20, a total of 6 ports are used by the Qotom. The other LAG, ports 21-24 are used by the Synology.

Steps to configuring your network switch are as follows:
#### 3.1.1 Create VLANs
In this example three VLANs are created - 1x WAN/VPN-egress (VLAN2) | 1x LAN-vpngate-world (VLAN30) | 1x LAN-vpngate-local (VLAN40). The below instructions are for the UniFi controller `Settings` > `Networks` > `Create New Network`
*  Create a new network to be used for Egress of encypted traffic out of network to your VPN servers.

| Description | Value | Notes |
| :---  | :---: | :--- |
| `Name` |VPN-egress| This network will be used as the WAN for Qotom pfSense OpenVPN clients (encrypted exit). |
| `Purpose` |Guest|  Network Guest security policies. |
| `VLAN` |2| A dedicated VLAN for the WAN used by OpenVPN client(s) for network paths and firewall rules use Guest security policies. |
| `Gateway/Subnet` |192.168.2.1/28| Only 2 addresses on this subnet so /29 is ideal |
| `DHCP Server` | Enabled | Just use default range 192.168.2.2 -- 192.168.2.14 |
| `Other Settings` | Just leave as Default | |

* Create **two** new VLAN only networks to be used as gateways to connect to OpenVPN clients running on the Qotom and pfSense router.

| Description | Value | Notes |
| :---  | :---: | :--- |
| `Name` |**LAN-vpngate-world**| This is the network where LAN clients will be restricted to the vpngate-world server |
| `Purpose` |VLAN Only| This is critical. We don't want the UniFi USG to do anything with any client on this VLAN other than be sure that they can get to their gateway. |
| `VLAN` |30|  |
| `IGMP Snooping` |Disabled|  |
| `DHCP Guarding` |Disabled|  |
|||
| `Name` |**LAN-vpngate-local**| This is the network where LAN clients will be restricted to the vpngate-world server |
| `Purpose` |VLAN Only| This is critical. We don't want the UniFi USG to do anything with any client on this VLAN other than be sure that they can get to their gateway. |
| `VLAN` |40|  |
| `IGMP Snooping` |Disabled|  |
| `DHCP Guarding` |Disabled|  |

#### 3.1.2 Setup network switch ports
In this example network switch ingress port 19 is associated with vpngate-world and ingress port 20 is associted with vpngate-local. The below instructions are for the UniFi controller `Devices` > `Select device - i.e UniFi Switch 24/48` > `Ports`  and select port 19 or 20 and edit and `apply` as follows:

| Description | Value | Notes |
| :---  | :---: | :--- |
| `Name` |**Port 19**|  |
| `Switch Port Profile` |LAN-vpngate-world (30)| This will put switch port 19 on VLAN30 |
|
| `Name` |**Port 20**|  |
| `Switch Port Profile` |LAN-vpngate-local (40)| This will put switch port 20 on VLAN30 |

#### 3.1.3 Setup secure VPN WiFi SSiDs
In this example two VPN secure WiFI SSIDs are created. and all traffic on these WiFi connections will exit to the internet via VPN. The below instructions are for the UniFi controller `Settings` > `Wireless Networks` > `Create New Wireless Network`  as follows:

| Description | Value | Notes |
| :---  | :---: | :--- |
| `Name/SSID` |**hello-vpngate-world**| Call it whatever you like |
| `Enabled` |[x]| |
| `Security` | WPA Personal | Wouldnt recommend anything less |
| `Security Key` | password | Your choosing |
| `VLAN` |30| Must be set as 30 |
| `Other Settings` | Just leave as default| |
|
| `Name/SSID` |**hello-vpngate-local**| Call it whatever you like |
| `Enabled` |[x]| |
| `Security` | WPA Personal | Wouldnt recommend anything less |
| `Security Key` | password | Your choosing |
| `VLAN` |40| Must be set as 40 |
| `Other Settings` | Just leave as default| |

### 3.2 Configure Proxmox bridge networking
The Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 has 6x Gigabit NICs. 

| Proxmox NIC ID | enp1s0 | enp2s0 |enp3s0 | enp4s0 |enp5s0 | enp6s0 |
| :--- | :---:  | :---: | :---:  | :---: | :---:  | :---: |
|**Proxmox Linux Bond** | `bond0` | `bond0` | `bond1` | `bond1` | |  |
|**Proxmox Linux Bridge** | `vmbr0` | `vmbr0` | `vmbr1` | `vmbr1` | `vmbr2` | `vmbr3` |

If you are using the Qotom 4x Gigabit NIC model version then you dont have enough NIC ports to create LAGS because we require 4x connection addresses. A Qotom 4x Gigabit NIC PC router configuration would be as follows.

| Proxmox NIC ID | enp1s0 | enp2s0 |enp3s0 | enp4s0 |
| :--- | :---:  | :---: | :---:  | :---: |
|**Proxmox Linux Bridge** | `vmbr0` | `vmbr1` | `vmbr2` | `vmbr3` |

The following recipes are for the Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 unit. Amend for other hardware.

Go to Proxmox web interface of your Qotom node (should be https://192.168.1.101:8006/ ) `typhoon-01` > `System` > `Network` > `Create` > `Linux Bond` and fill out the details as shown below (must be in order). Here we are going to create two LAGs/Bonds.

| `Comment` |vpngate-local|

Note the bridge port corresponds to a physical interface identified above. The name for Linux Bridges must follow the format of vmbrX with â€˜Xâ€™ being a number between 0 and 9999. Last but not least, `vmbr0` is the default Linux Bridge which wouldve been setup when first installing Proxmox and DOES NOT need to be created. Simply edit the existing `vmbr0` by changing `Bridge port ==> bond0`.

Reboot the Proxmox node to invoke the system changes.

### 3.3 Install pfsense
In this step you will create two OpenVPN Gateways for the whole network using pfSense. These two OpenVPN Gateways will be accessible by connected devices, LAN and WiFi. The two OpenVPN Gateways are integated into separate VLAN networks:
   * `vpngate-world` - VLAN30 - This VPN client (used as a gateway) randomly connects to servers from a user determined safe list which should be outside of your country or nation. A safer zone.
   * `vpngate-local` - VLAN40 - This VPN client (used as a gateway) connects to servers which are either local, incountry or within your selected region and should provide a faster connection speed. 

#### 3.3.1 Download the latest pfSense ISO
You can use the Proxmox web gui or simply use proxmox typhoon-01 cli `>Shell` and type the following:
```
wget https://snapshots.pfsense.org/amd64/pfSense_master/installer/pfSense-CE-2.5.0-DEVELOPMENT-amd64-latest.iso.gz -P /var/lib/vz/template/iso &&
gzip -d pfSense-CE-2.5.0-DEVELOPMENT-amd64-latest.iso.gz
```

#### 3.3.2 Create a pfSense VM
You can create a pfSense VM by either using CLI or by the webgui.

Go to Proxmox web interface of your Qotom node (should be https://192.168.1.101:8006/ ) `typhoon-01` > `Create VM` and fill out the details as shown below (whats not shown below leave as default)

| Description | Value |
| :---  | :---: |
| `Node` |typhoon-01|
| `VM ID` | 251 |
| `Name` | pfsense |
| `Start at Boot` | Enabled |
| `Resource Pool` | Leave blank |
| `Use CD/DVD disc image file (ISO)` | pfSense-CE-2.5.0-DEVELOPMENT-amd64-latest.iso |
| `Guest OS` | Other |
| `Graphic card` | Default |
| `Qemu Agent` | Disabled |
| `SCSI Controller` | VirtIO SCSI |
| `BIOS` | Default (SeaBIOS) |
| `Machine` | Default (i440fx) |
| `Bus/Device` | VirtIO Block 0 |
| `Storage` | local-lvm |
| `Disk size (GiB)` | 32 |
| `Cache` | Default (No Cache) |
| `Sockers` | 1 |
| `Cores` | 2 |
| `Type` | host |
| `Memory (MiB)` | 2048 |
| ` Minimum Memory (MiB)` | 2048 |
| `Ballooning Device` | Enabled |
| `Bridge` | vmbr0 |
| `Model` | VirtIO (paravirtualized) |
| `Start after created` | Disabled |

Now using the Proxmox web interface `typhoon-01` > `251 (pfsense)` > `Hardware` > `Add` > `Network Device` create the following additional network bridges as shown below:

| Description | Value |
| :---  | :---: |
| `Bridge` | **vmbr1** |
| `VLAN Tag` | no VLAN |
| `Model` | VirtIO (paravirtualized) |
|
| `Bridge` | **vmbr2** |
| `VLAN Tag` | no VLAN |
| `Model` | VirtIO (paravirtualized) |
|
| `Bridge` | **vmbr3** |
| `VLAN Tag` | no VLAN |
| `Model` | VirtIO (paravirtualized) |

Or if you prefer you can simply use Proxmox typhoon-01 cli `>Shell` and type the following to achieve the same thing (Note: the below script is for a Qotom Mini PC Q500G6-S05 with 6x Gigabit NICs ONLY):
```
qm create 251 --bootdisk virtio0 --cores 2 --cpu host --ide2 local:iso/pfSense-CE-2.5.0-DEVELOPMENT-amd64-latest.iso,media=cdrom --memory 2048 --name pfsense --net0 virtio=AA:EE:88:D4:26:E4,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1 --net1 virtio=6E:C1:23:F4:1A:7D,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1 --net2 virtio=92:10:6F:1E:B8:BD,bridge=vmbr2,firewall=1,tag=30 --net3 virtio=72:E8:93:32:7B:D3,bridge=vmbr3,firewall=1,tag=40 --numa 0 --onboot 1 --ostype other --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --smbios1 uuid=a386d1df-b3ab-4694-9f1c-e002e7eb30c5 --sockets 1 --virtio0 local-lvm:vm-251-disk-0,size=32G --vmgenid 3cc5ea9e-670e-4571-b45c-7c97f0a27ade
